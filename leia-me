Basic Application Management:

pm2 start <app_name_or_file> --name "<app_name>": Starts an application. Use --name to give it a specific name. If you don't use --name, the filename is used as the name.
pm2 list: Lists all running applications managed by PM2.
pm2 stop <app_name_or_id>: Stops a specific application (use the name or ID from pm2 list).
pm2 restart <app_name_or_id>: Restarts a specific application.
pm2 delete <app_name_or_id>: Deletes a specific application from PM2's process list.
pm2 reload <app_name_or_id>: Gracefully reloads an application (useful for zero-downtime deployments).
pm2 monit: Opens a simple monitoring dashboard in your terminal.
pm2 describe <app_name_or_id>: Provides detailed information about an application.
Log Management:

pm2 logs <app_name_or_id>: Shows logs for a specific application.
pm2 flush <app_name_or_id>: Clears the logs for a specific application.
pm2 reset <app_name_or_id>: Resets the log file for a specific application.
Startup Management (Crucial for production):

pm2 startup <platform>: Generates a startup script for PM2 (e.g., pm2 startup systemd, pm2 startup upstart, pm2 startup darwin). Run the command that PM2 provides after running pm2 startup.
pm2 save: Saves the current process list so PM2 can restore it on reboot. Run this after starting your apps and after running pm2 startup.
pm2 resurrect: Restores the process list saved with pm2 save.
Ecosystem Files (For complex apps):

pm2 start ecosystem.config.js: Starts applications defined in an ecosystem file.
Other Useful Commands:

pm2 kill: Kills the PM2 daemon.
pm2 update: Updates PM2.
Key things to remember:

Application Names: Use descriptive names when starting your apps (pm2 start ... --name "my-app") to make management easier.
Startup on Reboot: The pm2 startup and pm2 save commands are essential to make sure your applications start automatically when your server restarts.
Ecosystem Files: Use ecosystem files (ecosystem.config.js or ecosystem.config.yaml) for more complex application setups (environment variables, multiple instances, etc.).
This list covers the most common and important PM2 commands you'll likely use.  For more advanced options, refer to the official PM2 documentation: https://pm2.io/doc/en/runtime/reference/pm2-cli
